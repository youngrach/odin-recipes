        <p class="info">
            Blueberry toast is an unconventional sweet snack that's 
            refreshing, easy to make, customizable, and nutritious. 
            The thawing blueberries take center stage as they 
            burst in your mouth with each bite, while a layer of 
            thick yogurt provides a smooth, tart backdrop.

        <h2 class="blueberry">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="info">
            <li>Crusted bread, sliced and &lpar;optionally&rpar; toasted</li>
            <li>Almond butter</li>
            <li>Skyr</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Frozen blueberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="blueberry">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="info">
            <li>Spread a layer of almond butter on each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Spoon a layer of skyr onto the bread, smoothing it into an even layer roughly 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle cinnamon over the yogurt layer.</li>
            <li>Stick frozen blueberries into the yogurt, packing them as close together as your heart desires. 
                The yogurt will freeze slightly and act as a glue to keep the blueberries stuck together.
